    "Nominal encoding, also known as one-hot encoding, is a technique used to convert categorical variables into numerical format by creating binary vectors for each category. Each category becomes a binary feature column with values 0 or 1 indicating the presence or absence of that category.\n",

    "In a real-world scenario of analyzing customer preferences for clothing colors, suppose you have a categorical feature \"Color\" with values [\"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Green\"]. Using nominal encoding, you would create three binary columns: \"Is_Red,\" \"Is_Blue,\" and \"Is_Green.\" Each customer's preference would then be represented as a binary vector, such as [1, 0, 0] for \"Red,\" [0, 1, 0] for \"Blue,\" and [0, 0, 1] for \"Green.\" This encoding allows machine learning algorithms to understand and process color preferences as numerical data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suitability: One-hot encoding is suitable for categorical variables with a small number of unique values, such as 5 in this case. It creates binary columns representing each unique category, ensuring that the data is appropriately represented for machine learning algorithms.\n",

    "Maintains Information: One-hot encoding preserves the distinctiveness of each category by creating separate binary columns. This is crucial in scenarios where each category represents a different concept or characteristic that should not be merged or treated as ordinal.\n",

    "Ease of Implementation: One-hot encoding is straightforward to implement using libraries like scikit-learn or pandas in Python. It is a widely used encoding technique for handling categorical data in machine learning pipelines.\n",
