It introduces a regularization parameter to the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to shrink the coefficients and thus regularize or penalize them, which helps to prevent overfitting.\n",

    "### Assumptions of Ridge Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression, like ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, relies on several key assumptions. However, ridge regression is more robust to violations of some of these assumptions, particularly multicollinearity. Here are the main assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity**: The relationship between the predictors and the response variable is linear. This means the model assumes that the response variable can be expressed as a linear combination of the predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other. This means the value of the response variable for one observation is not dependent on the value of the response variable for another observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of the error terms is constant across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, the spread of the residuals should be roughly the same at all levels of the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Normality of Errors**: The error terms (residuals) are normally distributed. This assumption is more crucial for hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals rather than for the estimation of the coefficients themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **No Perfect Multicollinearity**: There is no perfect multicollinearity, meaning the predictors are not perfectly linearly related. Ridge regression addresses this issue by adding a penalty term, making it more tolerant of multicollinearity than OLS.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Fixed Design Matrix**: The matrix of predictor variables \\(X\\) is fixed and not random. This means the values of the predictor variables are assumed to be measured without error.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Sufficient Sample Size**: There should be a sufficient number of observations relative to the number of predictors to ensure reliable estimation of the coefficients. Ridge regression can handle cases where the number of predictors exceeds the number of observations, but having more observations than predictors is still preferable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that while ridge regression can mitigate some issues associated with multicollinearity, it does not completely eliminate the need for careful consideration of the model assumptions. Violations of these assumptions can still impact the performance and interpretability of the model.\n"

    "### Selecting the Value of the Tuning Parameter (Lambda) in Ridge Regression\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Magnitude of Coefficients**:\n",

    "\n",
    "5. **Relative Importance**:\n",
    "   - To interpret the impact of each predictor, compare the magnitude of the coefficients. Variables with larger absolute values are more influential in predicting the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
